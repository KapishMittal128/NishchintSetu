# Nishchint Setu

**Your bridge to safety. Real-time conversation monitoring to protect you from scams.**

Nishchint Setu is a web application designed to provide real-time protection against phone scams, with a focus on ease of use for elderly users and peace of mind for their loved ones.

## Core Features

-   **Local-First Analysis**: Utilizes the browser's built-in Web Speech API to perform real-time transcription and risk analysis directly on the user's device. No audio is ever sent to the cloud, ensuring complete privacy.
-   **Role-Based Access**:
    -   **User Role**: Allows individuals to monitor their own conversations. The app generates a unique, shareable ID for each user.
    -   **Emergency Contact Role**: Allows family members or friends to pair with a User's account using their unique ID.
-   **Real-Time Risk Detection**: The app analyzes transcribed conversations for keywords and patterns commonly associated with scams, calculating a live risk score.
-   **Persistent Notifications**: When a User's conversation risk score exceeds a certain threshold, a timestamped notification is saved to `localStorage`.
-   **Emergency Contact Dashboard**: The Emergency Contact's dashboard automatically displays any high-risk alerts generated by their paired User, providing immediate awareness of potential threats.
-   **Persistent State**: The entire application state—including role selection, profile completion, UID pairing, and notifications—is stored in `localStorage`, ensuring a seamless experience across browser sessions without a traditional backend or database.
-   **Calm, Accessible UI**: The interface is designed following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, with a focus on clarity, large text, and simple language to be friendly and reassuring for elderly users.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework**: Next.js (with React)
-   **UI**: ShadCN UI Components & Tailwind CSS
-   **State Management**: React Hooks with `localStorage` for persistence.
-   **Transcription**: Browser's native Web Speech API
